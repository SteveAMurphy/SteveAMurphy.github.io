        <p class="lead">I have always had an interest in automation and computer aided manufacture so the description of the module appealed to me as it involved the use of sensors and actuators, inputs and outputs and an element of coding.</p>
        <p class="lead">Coming from a background of manufacture and more recently the area of product design, I think this module and the knowledge I have gained from it will stand to me in the future. More and more I am asked to help students develop their representative models into something a bit more interactive. I think the Arduino platform will be perfect for this. </p>
        <p class="lead">It would be a lie if I said that I did not find the module tough. There was a very steep learning curve and most of the fundamentals of arduino coding were new to me. Coding of any kind is a new experience. But I am very happy with my output all things considered.</p>

  <h1 class="display-4">Physical Computing Major Project</h1>
  <p class="lead">For the final major project of my module on Physical Computing I designed and built an interactive game for kids aged 8 and upwards.</p>
  <p class="lead">The intention behind the game was to use the skills leared in the module to design and build a system based on Arduino to address a topic of my choice. The project was a group project so our team decided on the topic of Games. From that general topic, I decided to explore using Arduino to develop an educational game. Math-Duino was the result.</p>
<p class="lead">My research led me to the sub-topic of mathematics. This is an area of primary education which lends itself well to the Arduino platform for developing kids mathematics skills. The players can choose between a Trigonometry game where they need to guess the angle of a needle and an Multiplication game to help them to revise their multiplication tables.</p>
<p class="lead">Not only does the system encourage kids to develop their mathematics skills, Math-Dunio also takes kids away from screens and touch based screen games and helps develop fine motor skills and spacial skills.</p>
<p class="lead">I have shared some of the steps of the development process below. As usual, there is some reflection on each step.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">As part of the process of developing the Math-Duino code, a wiring and component diagram was generated in Tinkercad. This system helped to figure out the connection before going onto the physical build. With the addition of code, the entire system could be tested virtually. A great way to iron out any issues before commiting to wiring and reducing the risk of shorting any of the limited components needed for the build. </p>

At this stage it's all about testing the system. There are many rapid changes to the set-up and the code. The configuration of the system is only just now coming together so there is no point being too structured and organised. Get it working and go from there.</p>
                              <p class="card-text">I learned alot from this stage. I began by using the Arduino srtarter kit but I found that this Seeduino kit had quick connect wiring so it was much faster to re-configure.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">As with any prototype, there is room for improvement. Given the opportiunity I plan to re-configure this system so that a user can pick it up and play it like a handheld game.

                <h4 class="card-title text-center">Lab 1 - Buttons and L.E.D's</h4>
              <p class="card-text">Start from the very beginning. This first lab introduced us to the Arduino board, breadboards, Arduino components and the Arduino IDE where the code is generated and modified.</p>
                <p class="card-text">The final outcome of the lab was potentiometer controlling the brightness of an L.E.D. when a push button was pressed.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Overall I am happy with my output from this lab, considering I went into it completely un-educated in Arduino, I think this basic exercise was very beneficial as controlling a light with buttons and potentiometers is almost in every electronic device</p>

            <p class="card-text">The second lab concentrated on Power Wave Manipulation. This is the process of converting analog input from the potentiometer to digital output on the RGB L.E.D. using mapping to measure the voltage and convert it to the values fo the RGB L.E.D. A temperature sensor was also used to test the analog input.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Looking back I can see the logic in progressing through the labs. Each one builds on the previous work and adds new elements. The RGB LED is in interesting component. It can re-create most colours by combining the Red Green and Blue. I can see this component becoming part of my Go-to prototyping kit. </p>
            <p class="card-text">Although I enjoyed the lab, the programming of the code was very challenging. I got there, but I plan to re-visit this exercise and have another go.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Skipping forward a little. The final lab before the major assignment introduced us to LCD displays on the hardware side and Functions on the coding side.</p>
                <p class="card-text">The system in the image here is the prototype equivalent of a Magic 8 Ball. When the system is rocked, it generates a random response on the LCD screen. In the coding, functions are used to generate the random reply.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Even after completing the lab I am looking at the code and it surprises me that I was able to figure this all out. It seems complex but becasue we were introdcued to each of the concepts gradually over time, it was not as daunting to come up with the code.</p>
