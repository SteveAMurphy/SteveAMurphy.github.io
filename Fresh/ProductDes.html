        <p>Navu is a re-deisgn of a firefighters SCBA mask to include crew accountability and navigation features as well as system diagnostics.</p>
        <p>This design uses movement sensors which are embedded in the firefighters clothing to track the movement of the firefighter as they navigate the inside of a building. The location tracking is processed and the information sent to a uint in teh firefighters SCBA mask. This unit then projects the information on the inside of the firefighters mask so they have an augmented vision of their surroundings.</p>
        <p>The system can also be used to inform the firefighrter of their remaining air supply, give the firefighter thermal imagiing overlayt of their surroundings and it will give them a reference map for when they need to re-trace their steps back out of the building</p>
        <p>Feedback from firefightes has been very positive and although the system was designed as an exploration inot how current state of the art technology could be used to help this particular group of users, it is only a speculative design exercise.</p>

        <p>This project was undertaken in a collaboration with Bijur Delimon Pumps</p>
        <p>The client, Bijur Delimon were launching a new pump and needed help with the Industrial Design of the pump. The mechaincs of the pump had already been configured so the scope of the design was on the aesthetic features and the pump conmtrol interface.</p>
        <p>Our team used participatory design to help the client develop the design and appreance they wanted for the pump.</p>
        <p>The outcome was a modern, industrially designed pump which was a radical move from the clients traditional pump design but which helped the new pump stand out from the competion. The product has been on the market for a number of years now and the desing is still a point of very positive discussion.</p>
        <p>On reflection, I would love to have another go at the user interface of the pump when I am finished my current postgraduate degree to see what improvements can be made. The labelling of the buttons is a weakness in my view.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Before the client could sign off on the final design of the pump, we used a block model to represent the overall shape and layout of the design.</p>
                <p class="card-text">The model above was constructed from CNC machined high density faom and some low density hand shaped foam components.</p>
                <p class="card-text">It was very helpfult o have a block model of the pump to reference. While doing things on CAD software like Solidworks is hugely beneficial, having a reference model for scaling purposed is very useful.</p>
