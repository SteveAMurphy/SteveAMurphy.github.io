                <p>I found this project really interesting and fun. Going out into nature and trying to capture some of the "in the moment" feelings was already a favourite pass-time of mine, so I didn't need alot of convincing!!!</p>

                            <p class="text-muted card-text">This image represents the fun things in life. Toys, imagination, recreation, and indeed life goals
                                are all represented in the image of this motorcycle cop as he diligently goes about his daily duties,
                                    protecting the citizens of Big Block City.</p>
                            <h6>Composition:</h6>
                            <p class=" text-muted card-text">The image follows the rule of thirds. The motorcyclists eye is at the intersection of the upper third
                                and the right third. The items in the background represent the sprawling metropolis and the depth
                                of field makes the main subject stand out.
                                The items and the main subject are arranged so that the source of light for the image corresponds
                                with the painted light reflection on the motorcycle and motorcyclist.
                                Different height blocks at different distances from the camera were used to add depth to the
                                image.</p>
                            <p class=" text-muted card-text">The aperture settings were restricted on my camera set-up, I would have preferred a bit
                                more depth of field. If I was trying to improve the image, I would proably add a little more fore-ground so that the shadow of the cyclist is not cut so severely on the right.</p>

                            <p class="text-muted card-text">The flow of water represents the flow of life, in this case, it is a torrent, a whirling unstoppable force
                                of life. At times we try to swim against the flow, the branch represents the futile nature of trying to
                                fight the passage of time.</p>
                            <p class="text-muted card-text">I wanted to get an image that showed movement. Photographs record a single moment in time, I
                                saw this as a challenge to try and give the image the apprearance of movement.</p>
                            <h6>Composition:</h6>
                            <p class="text-muted card-text">The image is roughly split into the traditional rule of thirds, with the tree-line in the background and
                                the suggested line from the stone wall in the foreground splitting the image into horizontal thirds.
                                The bushes either side and the alignment of the branch in the water with the edge of the stone also
                                split the image.The image needed a foreground to anchor the image so the stone wall remained in the lower left corner.
                                The trees at the far side of the river form the horizon line and were straightened in post processing.Finally, rather than have the flow of water from left to right which is preferred for viewing, the water flows from
                                right to left to further enhance the battle of the branch against the water flow.</p>

                            <p class="text-muted card-text">All life on earth came from water. It truly is the source of all life. As if to prove this, the image of
                                the stream shows the abundance of life that grows and exists because of water. Like the Nile delta
                                in Egypt, this little stream provides nutrients and water for the wealth of greenery it flows through.</p>
                            <h6>Composition</h6>
                            <p class="text-muted card-text">The sound of the small waterfall drew my attention so I went off the pathway and found this lovely
                                pool of Life. I took a number of test pictures and adjusted my settings with the intention of shooting
                                as much of the scene as possible and then cropping later in post. Using the rule of thirds as a guide,
                                I made the stream the center of the images, the water then flows slightly to the left before coming
                                back in the calm water flowing from left to right. The leaves frame the upper third and the two tree
                                trunks provide some symmetry. The picture was taken from an angle that allowed some of the suns
                                rays to hit the pool of water and bounce a reflection to provide even more life to the image</p>
                             <p class="text-muted card-text">I ended up cropping this image quiet a bit more that I would have liked. I think it lost some of the detail because of this. If re-taking it, I would frame it slightly better and not have to cut so much from the borders.</p>

	                        <p class="text-muted card-text">“Enormous Oak trees from tiny acorns grow”</p>
                            <p class="text-muted card-text">This image represents the start of life, as the Autumn season progresses this tiny seed will fall from the Oak
                                tree and if nurtured by nature, will grow to become a mighty Oak tree, thus the circle of life continues. Life
                                exists in all living things and nature is full of living things. Over millions of years the Oak tree has evolved its
                                seed to the size and shape we see in the image. Out of the thousands or millions of tree species, the acorns
                                form is relatively unique.</p>
                            <h6>Composition</h6>
                            <p class="text-muted card-text">The simplicity of the acorn draws the eye. It stands out from the leafy background. The main focal point is in
                                the top right section of the image, conforming to the rule of thirds. The colour of the acorn sets it apart from
                                the surrounding green of the leaves, again drawing the eye. The small water droplets on the acorn also seem
                                to pull the viewer further into the images.
                                Shutter speed was kept low so that any blurring of the moving branch in the breeze would be reduced.
                                The image reveals itself in three stages: we see the acorn first, then the water droplet as we focus more on
                                the acorn and then the rest of the image .
                                The subject of the images is close to the camera to cut out too many distractions, then further cropped in post.</p>
                             <p class="text-muted card-text">There is something that bugs me about this image. The texture of the nut and the water droplet on it just seems to be out of focus. When I zoom in, I dont think it is, but at this focal length, it jsut seems off. I'd love to go back with a macro lens and shoot it again. Although that nut is long gone!!!</p>

                             <p class="text-muted card-text">On refection, this would have been good in back and white too but the colours are also nice and vibrant. \The fact that the paw is cropped in the foreground is unfortunate but I ran out of image while cropping.</p>

                                light itself dances on the surface of the browning autumn leaves. The lamp in the image gives life
                                to the foliage which surrounds and encircles the lamp, almost enveloping it as if to try and share in
                                the warmth of the lamps glow.</p>
                            <p class="text-muted card-text">
                                Although the leaves may be fading as the winter draws near, there is still the appearance of life in
                                the green leaves in the background. A hope for life yet to be lived.</p>
                            <h6>Composition</h6>
                            <p class="text-muted card-text">This image attempted to find the natural sequence
                                (Fibonacci’s sequence in nature). The light falling on the leaves follows the sequence. After experimenting with trying to get the reflection of the lamp and leaves in a puddle of water, I
                                decided to take the shot directly at the lamp and
                                change the camera setting to counter the strong
                                light coming from the lamp.</p>
                             <p class="text-muted card-text">Although I love the colours in teh image and I am happy to have gotent a decent crack at the Fibonacci composition, the image looks a little thron together. At the time of shootinmg there was a puddle of water developing under the lamp post. I would have loved to have gotten a refelction shot on the puddle with the colours of the leaves. Maybe next year. </p>

In the old days, the coaches of tourists had an agreeement that they would all use the road as a one way system on the Ring of Kerry.</p>

As I drove along, I came accross a rocky outcrop that almost over-hung the road. Armed with my dslr I clombed the rock face and snapped this image. No processing, but look at tha view.</p>
