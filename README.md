This is a Website Portfolio built for Assignment 3 of CS6041 Autumn Semester 2020 of MA/MSc. in Interaction and Experience Design.

Before I go into the detail on what was used and where it was got. A breif reflection on the process of creating a webpage. 
That was a rollercoaster. From minor gains to major losses. I shouldnt find it strange that there is so much inforamtion online for anythign that needs to be done. 
All the issues I came accross had already been dealt with by other people. If web development did not have a serious online support system, then there is no hope for any of us.
The tutorial videos that were shared at the weekly lecture classes were great to fall back on. Even to get an overview of the Github basics.
At the start I said to myself just do a few copies of the Bio page we created in class and change the image and text, but as I became more accustomed to the process I decided to try new things. Not everything works and its definitely a first draft, but there are things I am happy with, like the image gallery and the jumbotrons. 
I would love to learn more about customising the CSS to make the website feel a little less like a series of containers but thats what Bootstrap seems to do well.

All in all, I'm happy, but I recognise there are improvements that could be made.
Next time!!!
