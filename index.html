          <P>I am a current student on the Masters in Interaction and Experience Design in University of Limerick.

My background is in manufacturing and product design. I am a qualified Toolmaker with experience in fabrication for the auto-electrical industry.</P>

<P>I am also a graduate of Product Design and Technology from the <a href="https://www.ul.ie/scieng/schools-and-departments/school-design">School of Design</a> in <a href="https://www.ul.ie/">University of Limerick.</a> Since graduating, I have been employed by the School of Design as a Technical Officer which usually involves helping students of the product design course to build prototypes and representational models of their designs.</P>

        <P>Outside of work and study, I like to get outdoors. I have just recently complete a VW campervan conversion so I like to head out and explore the countryside. I also enjoy any type of crafting and building as well as some very amateur photography.</P></div>
